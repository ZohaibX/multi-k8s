First of all go to https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard 
and copy kubectl command and run that on terminal in the same folder actually

run this command on my k8s folder
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/dashboard/v1.10.1/src/deploy/recommended/kubernetes-dashboard.yaml
and it will create a kubernetes dashboard file in k8s
and we have to make some changes in that file 

Open up the downloaded file in your code editor and find line 116. Add the following two lines underneath --auto-generate-certificates:
args:
  - --auto-generate-certificates
  - --enable-skip-login
  - --disable-settings-authorizer

Run the following command inside the directory where you downloaded the dashboard yaml file a few steps ago:
kubectl apply -f kubernetes-dashboard.yaml

Start the server by running the following command:
kubectl proxy

You can now access the dashboard by visiting:
http://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/https:kubernetes-dashboard:/proxy/

You will be presented with a login screen
you can skip that login and you'll be directed to dashboard
and you can also provide token by creating one after finding on google how to create
