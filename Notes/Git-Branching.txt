in the same directory in terminal 
(1)  git checkout -b devel
branch will be switched to devel

now we need to push the code ... like git push origin devel 

now in the github repo 
go to pull requests section 
click on the compare pull request 
and  enter create pull request from compare devel to base master (base: master <- compare devel)
and then write comments and crate pull request

then travis tests will show up on the same screen
and when all the test passes . then We will merge the request .
and once, we merge the requests in to base:master or base:main 
then i could delete devel branch or not delete

after merging,  travis will run again 


-- Coming Back to Main Branch 

1st git add .
git commit -m "" 
git checkout main
git push origin main 

if some error occurs in pushing code .. i will have to pull the code first 
git pull origin main 
then git add commit and push
