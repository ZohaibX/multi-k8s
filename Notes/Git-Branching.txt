in the same directory in terminal 
(1)  git checkout -b devel
branch will be switched to devel

now we need to push the code ... like git push origin devel 

now in the github repo 
go to pull requests section 
and  enter create pull request from compare devel to base master (base: master <- compare devel)
and then write comments and crate pull request
